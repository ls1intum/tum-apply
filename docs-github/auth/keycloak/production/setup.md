# Keycloak Production Setup for TUMApply

This documentation describes the setup and management of the **Keycloak Production instance** used for TUMApply. It
covers access, configuration, usage, and best practices to ensure a secure and stable production environment.

---

## Overview

The Keycloak Production instance is a critical component of the TUMApply authentication infrastructure. It is managed
and maintained by the AET Admins and serves both deployed test and production servers.

- **Access URL:** `https://keycloak.aet.cit.tum.de/realms/external_login/`
- **Managed by:** AET Admins
- **Data Persistence:** All data stored in this instance is persistent and must **never** be deleted.

---

## Access and Permissions

Access requires opening **two AET Admins Jira tickets**:

1. Request access to the Keycloak Admin Console
2. Request VPN access to the TUM AET chair network.

Access is only possible once both requests are approved, the account has been enabled, and the user is connected to the
**TUM AET VPN**. Without the VPN connection, the Admin Console is not reachable.

### Realm Access

Users accessing the production instance can only interact with the `external_login` realm. They do **not** have access
to the full Keycloak instance or other realms.

### Admin Access

- Access to the Keycloak admin UI or instance-level changes requires:
  - A valid VPN connection to the TUM AET network.
  - A configured and approved university account.
- For any changes to the instance itself (e.g., configuration, realms, themes), a **new admin ticket** must be submitted
  and approved.
- Direct access to the instance is restricted to authorized AET Admins.

## Differences between Development & Production

- The production instance configuration is largely identical to the Development instance, ensuring consistency between
  environments.
- However, certain Identity Providers (IdPs) and integrations are **production-only**:
  - Google
  - Apple
  - Microsoft
  - LDAP
- All Identity Providers (IdPs) are configured and managed exclusively by the AET Admins to ensure proper integration
  and compliance with institutional policies.
- The login and admin user interfaces differ from the Development instance because AET uses a customized Keycloak theme
  tailored for production use.

---

## Usage

- The instance is used for both deployed test and production TUMApply servers.
- No test or dummy user accounts should exist or be created in the production environment.
- All changes to clients, roles, and settings must be coordinated and approved by the project team and, if necessary,
  the AET Admins.

## Production Best Practices

To maintain a secure and reliable production environment, the following best practices must be followed:

- **Backups:** Regular backups of the Keycloak database and configuration must be performed to prevent data loss.
  (Admins will do that)
- **Security:**
  - Access is only possible via VPN with strict authentication.
  - Admin access is limited and controlled through tickets and approvals.
  - No test user accounts or credentials should be present.
- **Persistence:** All data in the production instance is persistent and must not be deleted or modified without proper
  authorization.
- **Export Procedure:**
  - Before making any configuration changes, export the current realm settings and clients.
  - Maintain versioned backups of exports for rollback if needed.
- **Coordination:** All changes must be reviewed and approved by the project team and coordinated with AET Admins to
  avoid disruptions.
- **Monitoring:** Regular monitoring of the instance health and usage is recommended to detect and resolve issues early.
