## Local LLM Setup (Using LM Studio)

This guide explains how to set up a local LLM (Large Language Model) service for development purposes using LM Studio.

### Prerequisites

- A running server instance with the `local` profile
- Newest version of LM Studio
- Sufficient disk space for downloading LLM models (typically 10-40GB per model)

### Setting up LM Studio

You can set up and use LM Studio either via the GUI or CLI as follows:

#### LM Studio GUI

**1. Install LM Studio**

Download LM Studio using the App Installer from here: https://lmstudio.ai/download

**2. Download the Model**

* Open the LM Studio GUI
* Go into the **Discover** tab in the side navigation bar
* Download the `gpt-oss-20b` model (this will take a few moments depending on your internet connection)
* Make sure **"Enable Local LLM Service"** is active

**3. Configure and activate the model**

* Go into the **Developer** tab in the side navigation bar
* Open the **"Select model to load"** dropdown menu at the top (middle):
  * Enable **"Manually choose model load parameters"**
  * Click on **"OpenAI's gpt-oss 20B"**
  * Give it context `32000`
  * Click on the button **"Load model"**

**4. Start the LMS server**
Toggle the **"Status"** switch to **"Running"**

The LLM service should now be running on http://localhost:1234.

#### LM Studio CLI

**1. Install LM Studio**

Install LM Studio using Homebrew by running the command below. This will will install the LM Studio app (GUI), which
comes packaged with the CLI.
For more information, see the [LM Studio CLI documentation](https://lmstudio.ai/docs/cli).

```bash
brew install --cask lm-studio
```

**2. Download the Model**

 ```bash
 lms get openai/gpt-oss-20b
 ```

**3. Configure and activate the model**

```bash
lms load openai/gpt-oss-20b --context-length 32000
```

**4. Start the LMS server**

```bash
lms server start
```

The LLM service should now be running on http://localhost:1234.

#### Verify the Service Works

Verify http://localhost:1234/api/v0/models lists the models.

The model `openai/gpt-oss-20b` should appear in the list.

## Testing the Integration

1. Start the TUMapply server
2. Call the storyWithStream API endpoint, i.e. `GET /api/ai/generate?message={message}`
   either on Swagger http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui.html or via clients like Postman
   **Note:** Calling the API requires authentication
3. View the **LMS Server logs**
1. Via CLI
    ```bash
    lms log stream
    ```
2. By opening LM Studio GUI and going into the Developer view
4. Verify the logs
1. include the prompt sent
2. show progress status
3. show the generated prediction

### Performance Considerations

- **Model Size**: Larger models provide better results but require more RAM and processing power. The `gpt-oss-20b`
  model is a good balance for development.
- **Context Length**: The `--context-length 32000` parameter controls how much text the model can process at once.
  Adjust based on your hardware capabilities.
- **GPU Acceleration**: LM Studio automatically uses GPU acceleration when available (Metal on macOS, CUDA on
  Linux/Windows).

### 🛠 Troubleshooting

#### Exit Code 6 When Loading a Model

If you encounter the following error:

```
🥲 Failed to load the model
Error loading model. (Exit code: 6)
```

This usually means the model cannot load because the required runtime engine is missing or broken.

##### ✅ Fix: Repair the MLX Runtime (macOS Apple Silicon)

1. Open **LM Studio**
2. In the left menu, click **LM Runtimes**
3. Under **Runtime Extension Packs**, find:

   **LM Studio MLX**

   (Engine used for MLX / Apple Silicon models)

4. If LM Studio detects an issue, a **Fix** button will appear
5. Click **Fix** to reinstall, update, or repair the engine

After the repair completes, try loading your model again.
