# Evaluation Module (Technical Documentation)

The **Evaluation Module** enables professors to evaluate applications within their research groups. It introduces workflows for structured decision-making (reviews), collaboration (internal comments, ratings), and applicant communication (accept/reject notifications). All operations are subject to strict authorization checks enforced by `CurrentUserService`.

## Reviews

### Server-Side Architecture

**Core Components:**

* `ApplicationEvaluationService` — orchestrates review logic (accept/reject), updates application state, persists review metadata, and triggers notifications via `AsyncEmailSender`.
* `ApplicationEvaluationRepository` / `ApplicationEvaluationRepositoryImpl` — provides persistence and query capabilities, including advanced filtering, search, and window navigation.
* `ApplicationReview` — domain entity storing decision metadata (reviewer, timestamp, reason/message).

**Key Behaviors:**

* **Accept flow:**

  * State transition: `SENT`/`IN_REVIEW` → `ACCEPTED`.
  * Optionally updates job state (`JobState.APPLICANT_FOUND`).
  * Optional applicant notification with professor-supplied message.
* **Reject flow:**

  * State transition: `SENT`/`IN_REVIEW` → `REJECTED`.
  * Notification uses predefined multilingual rejection templates (selected `RejectReason`).
* **Review persistence:**

  * Each decision is captured in an `ApplicationReview` entity and linked to the application.
* **Window queries:**

  * Implemented using **SQL window functions** (`ROW_NUMBER() OVER (ORDER BY …)`).
  * Purpose: efficiently determine the index of a given application in a filtered/sorted dataset.
  * Enables centered retrieval of a **window of applications** (carousel navigation) without loading the entire dataset.
* **Document download:**

  * All applicant files can be exported as a deterministic ZIP archive.
  * File naming based on `DocumentType` with optional numeric suffixes for duplicates.
  * Optional deterministic timestamps (`entry.setTime(0L)`) to allow reproducible binary output.

**Source Paths:**

* Service: `de/tum/cit/aet/evaluation/service/ApplicationEvaluationService.java`
* Repository: `de/tum/cit/aet/evaluation/repository/ApplicationEvaluationRepository.java`
* Repository Impl: `de/tum/cit/aet/evaluation/repository/impl/ApplicationEvaluationRepositoryImpl.java`

### Client-Side Architecture

**Core Components:**

* `ApplicationOverviewComponent` (`application-overview.component.ts`)

  * Provides paginated, sortable, and filterable tabular overviews of applications.
  * Synchronizes URL query params for deep-link consistency.
* `ApplicationDetailComponent` (`application-detail.component.ts`)

  * Renders a detailed carousel-like review view.
  * Handles application state transitions (e.g., marking as `IN_REVIEW`).
  * Integrates review dialogs and sub-sections for evaluation tasks.
* `ApplicationCarouselComponent`

  * Enables horizontal navigation between applications in detail view.
* `ReviewDialogComponent`

  * Encapsulates accept/reject workflows, including optional notifications and job-closing logic.

**Section Components (used within detail page):**

* `CommentSection` — inline collaborative notes (private to professors).
* `RatingSection` — per-professor scoring (−2 to +2).
* `DocumentSection` — renders individual applicant documents with inline preview/download.
* `DocumentDialog` — modal for grouped document downloads.
* `DescriptionList` — structured key-value display (e.g., metadata).
* `LinkList` — external reference links.
* `Prose` — sanitized rendering of formatted text.
* `Section` / `SubSection` — layout primitives for consistent structuring of detail content.

**Behavior:**

* Optimistic UI updates for state changes (accept/reject, rating, comments).
* Automatic reconciliation with server responses on failure.

## Comments

### Server-Side Architecture

**Core Components:**

* `InternalCommentService` — enforces authorization and ownership rules.
* `InternalCommentRepository` — persistence for `InternalComment` entities.

**Key Behaviors:**

* Comments are tied strictly to applications.
* Only authors can edit/delete their comments (`AccessDeniedException` if violated).
* Chronological ordering ensures review traceability.
* Endpoint access restricted to role `PROFESSOR`.

**Source Path:**

* Service: `de/tum/cit/aet/evaluation/service/InternalCommentService.java`

### Client-Side Architecture

* `CommentSection` (`comment-section.ts`)

  * Integrated directly into the detail page.
  * Provides create/update/delete functionality.
  * Optimistic UI updates; rollback on server error.
  * Edit/delete controls are visible only for the author of a comment.

---

## Ratings

### Server-Side Architecture

**Core Components:**

* `RatingService` — handles CRUD operations for ratings.
* `RatingRepository` — ensures integrity and efficient loading.
* `Rating` entity — captures per-professor rating values.

**Key Behaviors:**

* Values range from **−2 to 2** (5-point Likert scale).
* Constraint `uc_ratings_application_user` enforces uniqueness of `(application, user)` pairs.
* Operations:

  * Create new rating if none exists.
  * Update in-place if rating exists.
  * Delete if `null` passed.
* Query optimization:

  * Ratings loaded together with reviewer to avoid N+1 select issues.

**Source Path:**

* Service: `de/tum/cit/aet/evaluation/service/RatingService.java`

### Client-Side Architecture

* `RatingSection` (`rating-section.ts`)

  * Integrated into the detail page.
  * Displays current user’s rating distinctly from others.
  * Supports inline updates/removals with optimistic UI behavior.
  * Restores server values in case of persistence errors.
