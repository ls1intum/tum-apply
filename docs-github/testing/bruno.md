# Bruno for API Testing

Bruno is an open-source API client, similar to Postman, but focused on a local-first and Git-friendly workflow.

## How Bruno works

- Bruno stores collections as plain folder and text files in the git repository.
- You can send requests with environment variables, use OAuth2 flows, and inspect responses.
- The folder `docs/TUMapply API` contains all relevant requests for testing authentication and the TUMApply API.
