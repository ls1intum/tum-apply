### Test Coverage

<!-- This section is automatically updated by the PR Coverage Reporter workflow after the PR check completes. -->
<!-- You can also generate the coverage table locally by running `npm run coverage:pr` (see supporting_scripts/local-pr-coverage/README.md). -->
<!-- The line coverage must be above 80% for changed files, and you must use extensive and useful assertions for server tests and expect statements for client tests. -->
<!-- Note: Confirm in the last column that you have implemented extensive assertions for server tests and expect statements for client tests. -->
<!--       Remove rows with only trivial changes from the table. -->

### Screenshots

<!-- Add screenshots to demonstrate the changes in the UI. Remove the section if you did not change the UI. -->
<!-- Create a GIF file from a screen recording in a docker container https://toub.es/2017/09/11/high-quality-gif-with-ffmpeg-and-docker/ -->
