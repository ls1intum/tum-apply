## 📄 Documents

On the review page, you will see a preview of the most relevant documents (e.g., CV, transcripts) directly inline. This makes it easy to assess applicants without leaving the page.

If you want to view all submitted documents in full size, click the **_View_** button in the document section. A dedicated document viewer will open, allowing you to navigate through every file submitted by the applicant.

For offline access or sharing within your group, use the **_Download All_** button. This will create a ZIP archive containing all documents submitted with the application.

### ▶️ Step-by-Step

1. **Open the Applications Overview Page**

Go to the *Review* tab. You’ll see all applications for your positions.

2. **Select an applicant**

Click on the _More_ button of an application to open the detailed review view.

3. **Inspect documents**

Use the inline viewer to read submitted files (CV, transcripts, letters). For full access, click *View All* or *Download All*.

4. **Review applicant profile**

Look at structured data — education, previous experience, and motivation statements.

5. **Provide a rating**

Choose from the rating scale: **Poor, Fair, Satisfactory, Good, Excellent**.
*(Note: Ratings are only visible to your research group, not to the applicant.)*

6. **Leave comments**

Add qualitative feedback or observations.
*(Comments are also internal and not shared with applicants.)*

7. **Make a decision**

Use the *Accept* or *Reject* buttons under the carousel. A confirmation dialog will appear.

* If you accept, you can optionally close the position and notify the applicant.
* If you reject, select a reason and confirm.

8. **Notify the applicant**

The dialog includes a *Notify Applicant* checkbox (pre-checked). You may uncheck if you wish to send a message later or externally.

9. **Continue with next applications**

Use the carousel to move to the next applicant seamlessly.

10. **Track status changes**

After decisions, application statuses update automatically (e.g. “In Review” → “Accepted” or “Rejected”).

:::tip[Tip]
Keep your browser window wide enough to show details, documents, and the rating panel side by side — this reduces scrolling and speeds up your review workflow.
