# Research Groups and Rights

When you log in to TUMApply for the first time as a professor, your account will only have basic rights. To proceed and
fully manage your positions, you need to have a Research Group set up for you.

## What are Research Groups?

Research Groups are organizational units within TUMApply that allow you to manage job postings and applications related
to your academic team. They serve as the basis for assigning responsibilities and rights to professors. In general,
Research Groups correspond to chairs and professorships at TUM.

## How to set up a Research Group and receive rights

:::danger[Important]
Please log in once with your TUM Login before sending us your email. This ensures your account is created
in the system. See our [login documentation](./login) for more information.
:::

To receive the correct permissions and have your Research Group created, you need to send us an email with the following
information:

- **Research Group name**
- **Name of the head of the Research Group** (including academic title if applicable)

If a Research Group already exists, please send us an email with the name of the Research Group and the name of its
head, so that you can be added to it.

Please send your email to: **support-tum-apply.aet@xcit.tum.de**

## What happens next

- After receiving your request, our team will verify the details.
- We will then set up your Research Group in the system.
- You will receive a confirmation email once the Research Group has been created and the appropriate rights have been
  assigned.
- After that, you have the correct professor rights and can manage your Research Group and its job postings.

We aim to process these requests as quickly as possible so you can start working with your Research Group without delay.
