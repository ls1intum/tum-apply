## ⚙️ Steps for Reviewing an Application

Follow these steps to evaluate and manage applications.

### 📌 Prerequisites

* You are logged in to TUMApply.
* You belong to a research group or have permissions to access the position.
* At least one candidate has submitted an application.

### ▶️ Step-by-Step

1. **Open the Applications Overview**
   Go to the *Review* tab. You’ll see all applications for your positions.

2. **Select a candidate**
   Click on an application to open the detailed review view.

3. **Inspect documents**
   Use the inline viewer to read submitted files (CV, transcripts, letters). For full access, click *View All* or *Download All*.

4. **Review applicant profile**
   Look at structured data — education, previous experience, and motivation statements.

5. **Provide a rating**
   Use the predefined criteria and assign scores (e.g. on a 5-point scale) to evaluate fit.

6. **Leave comments**
   Add qualitative feedback or observations. These comments are internal to your research group.

7. **Decide**
   Use the *Accept* or *Reject* buttons in the carousel. A confirmation dialog will appear.

  * If you accept, you can optionally close the position and notify the applicant.
  * If you reject, select a reason and confirm.

8. **Notify the applicant**
   The dialog includes a *Notify Applicant* checkbox (pre-checked). You may uncheck if you wish to send a message later or externally.

9. **Continue with next applications**
   Use the carousel to move to the next candidate seamlessly.

10. **Track status changes**
    After decisions, application statuses update automatically (e.g. “In Review” → “Accepted” or “Rejected”).

> **Tip:** Keep your browser window wide enough to show details, documents, and the rating panel side by side — this reduces scrolling and speeds up your review workflow.
