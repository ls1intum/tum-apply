## ⚙️ Features

* **Application Carousel**  
  Navigate seamlessly between multiple applications without returning to the overview. Each card displays the applicant’s name, status, and a summary of existing ratings, making comparisons quick and intuitive.

* **Decision Actions**  
  Prominently placed **Accept** and **Reject** buttons allow professors to make decisions directly on the page. Actions are clearly visible and easy to access, ensuring a smooth review flow.

* **Applicant Details**  
  A structured layout presents demographic information, academic background, and the motivation letter. Clear separation of structured (degrees, grades) and unstructured (free-text) data ensures readability and comparability.

* **Document Viewer** 
  Inline previews of uploaded files (CV, transcripts, recommendation letters, etc.) enable quick inspection without leaving the system. A **Download All** option provides a ZIP archive for offline use, while standardized labels ensure clarity across all documents.

* **Ratings System**
  Evaluate candidates across predefined criteria using a five-point Likert scale (_Poor_, _Fair_, _Satisfactory_, _Good_, _Excellent_). Visual bars show aggregated ratings, helping professors see group tendencies at a glance.

* **Comments Section**
  Leave private comments or notes for colleagues. Comments remain internal to the research group and are not visible to applicants, supporting candid collaboration.

## ⚙️ Steps for Application Review

This section outlines key steps for evaluating and managing applications through the review page.

### 📌 Prerequisites
- Professor account access with review permissions for published positions
- Active positions that have received applications from candidates

### ▶️ Step-by-step

1) **Open the Review Page & select an application**
  - From the **Overview Page**, click **More** on an application, or use the **carousel** at the top of the Review Page to pick a candidate.
  - **Status tip:** Opening an ⚪ *Unopened* application moves it into the 🟡 *In Review* state.

2) **Scan the Applicant Details**
  - Review the structured profile: personal info, education, degrees/grades, and the motivation letter.
  - Use the consistent grid layout to quickly compare key qualifications across candidates.

3) **Inspect Documents inline**
  - Open transcripts, CV, and recommendation letters directly in the embedded **Document Viewer**.
  - Use **View All** for the complete set, or **Download All** to get a ZIP for offline reading.
  - Standardized labels (e.g., “CV”, “Master Transcript”) help you recognize files at a glance.

4) **Provide Ratings & Comments**
  - Rate the candidate on predefined criteria using the **five-point Likert scale** (_Poor_, _Fair_, _Satisfactory_, _Good_, _Excellent_).
  - Check the **distribution bars** to see how others rated the same criteria.
  - Add **comments** to justify your assessment or leave notes for colleagues. Comments are **internal** to your group and never visible to applicants.

5) **Make a decision: Accept or Reject**
  - Click **Accept** ✅ or **Reject** ❌ directly on the page.
  - If configured, select a **reject reason** before confirming.
  - Upon confirmation, the status switches to 🟢 *Accepted* or 🔴 *Rejected* and the candidate is **automatically notified**.
  - Use the **carousel** to move to the next application without returning to the overview.

> **Tip:** Keep your browser window wide enough to view details, documents, and the rating panel comfortably—this reduces scrolling and speeds up reviews.
