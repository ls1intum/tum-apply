# Account Creation

As a professor, you **do not need a separate registration form**. Your TUMApply account is created automatically the
first time you sign in via the official TUM Login.

## Where to start

1. Open the professor page: [https://tumapply.aet.cit.tum.de/professor](https://tumapply.aet.cit.tum.de/professor)
2. Click **Login** and authenticate with your **university ID** (e.g., `ab12cde`) and the password you use for other TUM
   services (e.g., TUMOnline).
3. After successful authentication, you will be redirected back to the TUMApply landing page and your account will be
   created automatically.

## Rights on first login

On your first login, you will **initially have the same rights as applicants**. This is normal.

To receive professor rights and work with your Research Group, continue here:

- **Research Groups:** [Set up and manage your research group](../research-groups.md)
- **Roles & Permissions:** [How professor rights are assigned](../roles.md)

## Tips

- You can browse public listings without being logged in.
- If you can log in successfully but don’t see professor features, your rights may not be assigned yet—follow the pages
  above to proceed.
