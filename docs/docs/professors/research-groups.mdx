# Research Groups and Rights

When you log in to TUMApply for the first time as a professor, your account will only have basic rights. To proceed and
fully manage your positions, you need to have a Research Group set up for you.

## What are Research Groups?

Research Groups are organizational units within TUMApply that allow you to manage job postings and applications related
to your academic team. They serve as the basis for assigning responsibilities and rights to professors. In general,
Research Groups correspond to chairs and professorships at TUM.

## How to request access to a Research Group and receive rights

Once you log in as a **professor** or **employee** for the first time, a **dialog will automatically appear** that
guides you
through the process of requesting access to a Research Group.

### Request Process

1. Log in with your account.
2. The **access request dialog opens automatically**.
3. Depending on your role, you will be guided through different request steps:
  - **Professor:** You must provide several details, such as:
    - Research Group
    - Address
    - Additional required organizational information
  - **Employee:** You only need to provide the **name of the responsible professor**.
4. After submitting the request, it will be reviewed by our team.
5. Within the following days, you will receive an **email with further instructions**.

### If the Dialog Does Not Appear

If the dialog does not open automatically after login, you can request access manually at any time:

1. Go to the professor landing page:
   https://tumapply.aet.cit.tum.de/professor
2. **Log in** with your account.
3. Scroll down to the **FAQ section**.
4. Use the **button in the FAQ section** to open the same access request form manually.

## What happens next

- After receiving your request, our team will verify your details.
- We will then set up your Research Group in the system.
- You will receive an **email with the next steps** once your request has been processed.
- After successful verification, you will receive the appropriate rights to manage or work within your Research Group.
- From that point on, you can manage job postings and applications according to your role.

We aim to process all access requests as quickly as possible so you can start working with your Research Group without
delay.
