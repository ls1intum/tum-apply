2. Receive and confirm a verification code by email.
3. Provide personal details (e.g. first name, last name).
4. After successful verification, you are logged in automatically and can continue uploading documents and writing
your application texts. Any additional data provided by the external login providers (e.g. Google or Apple) will be
automatically imported into your application.
