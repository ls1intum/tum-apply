# Account Creation

You can browse all open job postings on TUMApply without an account. An account is only necessary if you want to apply
for positions or save and view your personal information and application(s).

As an applicant, you can easily create your account and log in to TUMApply.

## How to Register

1. Click the **Login** button in the upper right corner.
2. In the dialog that opens, click on **Register here** at the bottom.
3. Choose one of the following options:

- **Google**: You will be redirected to Google and follow their instructions.
- **Apple**: You will be redirected to Apple and follow their instructions.
- **Email**: Enter your email address and you will receive a verification code. Enter the received code in the
  dialog to confirm your email. After verifying your email, you will be asked to provide your **first name** and **last
  name**. Finally, you can optionally set a password. If you do so, you can later log in using your email and
  password instead of receiving a code each time.

Once registration is complete, you will be redirected to the landing page where you can see your personal information.

## Important Notes

If you start an application without having registered yet, an account will automatically be created during the
process:

1. Enter your email address.
2. Receive and confirm a verification code by email.
3. Provide personal details (e.g. address, first name, last name).
4. After successful verification, you are logged in automatically and can continue uploading documents and writing
   your application texts. Any additional data provided by the login provider (e.g. Google or Apple) will be
   automatically imported into your application.
