## üìù Application Editing Wizard

Applicants can **create** or **edit** their applications in a guided three-step process with auto-save functionality:

### Step 1: Personal & Contact Information

### Step 2: Academic Background & Transcript Uploads

### Step 3: Application Details & Document Uploads

A **progress stepper** displays the steps and their state, enabling users to navigate forwards/backwards, auto-save drafts, and finally **send** the application.

### Purpose

This component allows applicants to:

- **Create** a new application or **edit** an existing one.
- Complete the form in steps, with real-time validation.
- **Auto-save** progress while filling out the form.
- Upload relevant documents: transcripts, CV, reference letters.
- Submit the final application once all required fields are filled.

### Page Layout & User Flow

#### Form Wizard

- Uses a **three-step progress stepper** (via `jhi-progress-stepper`), integrating each page as a templated panel.
- Custom step buttons:

  - **Next** / **Prev**: navigate with validation checks.
  - **Cancel** (on Step 1): automatically autosaves and returns.
  - **Send** (on Step 3): final submission.

#### Auto-Save & Submission Strategy

- Automatically **saves draft** every 3 seconds when form changes are detected and `savingState` is `SAVING`.
- On navigation ("_Next_"/"_Previous_"), partial updates and document rename updates are triggered.
- Final "**send**" action (**SENT**) submits application.
- The form maintains save status via UI badge (`SAVING` ‚Üí `SAVED`).
