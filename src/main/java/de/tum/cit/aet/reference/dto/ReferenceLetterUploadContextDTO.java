 * @param applicantFirstName first name of the applicant who requested the letter
 * @param applicantLastName  last name of the applicant who requested the letter
 * @param jobTitle           title of the job the applicant is applying to
 * @param researchGroupName  name of the research group running the position
 * @param deadline           deadline by which the referee must upload the letter
 * @param status             current request status (controls whether the upload form is shown)
 * @param confidential       whether the applicant waived access, so only the professor will see the letter
